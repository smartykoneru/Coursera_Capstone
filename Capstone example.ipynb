One such public platform is Github.\nIf you do not yet know what Github is, suffice to know that it is a development platform that provides teams, developers, and even individuals with the ability to host, review, and maintain their code and control it with version control. Also, one can fork a repository, meaning copy the source code, and then customize it for their own applications without impacting the original source code. In summary, it is an awesome tool and a must-have skill for any aspiring data scientist.\nHowever, I often get approached by aspiring data scientists having trouble with creating a Github repository and setting it up properly so that they are able to continuously save their work to the repository, or to sync it with the local version of the repository, without any issues. Therefore, I decided to write this post to walk those having difficulties with Github through the process of creating a Github repository and setting it up properly so that they are able to seamlessly sync it with its local version."
